    <description>
      Scilab is free and open source software for numerical computation providing a powerful computing environment for engineering and
      scientific applications.

      Scilab includes hundreds of mathematical functions. It has a high level programming language allowing access to advanced data
      structures, 2-D and 3-D graphical functions.

      #### Features

      * Maths and Simulation for usual engineering and science applications including mathematical operations and data analysis.
      * 2-D and 3-D Visualization graphics functions to visualize, annotate and export data and many ways to create and customize various types of plots and charts.
      * Optimization algorithms to solve constrained and unconstrained continuous and discrete optimization problems.
      * Statistics tools to perform data analysis and modeling.
      * Control System Design and Analyse standard algorithms and tools for control system study.
      * Signal Processing to visualize, analyze and filter signals in time and frequency domains.
      * Application Development to increase Scilab native functionalities and manage data exchanges with external tools.
      * Xcos - Hybrid dynamic systems modeler and simulator for modeling mechanical systems, hydraulic circuits, control systems...

      #### Scilab as a platform

      Thanks to its ability to interconnect with third-party technologies and applications, Scilab can also act as a
      unique platform to bring together codes written in different programming languages in a single, unified
      language, thus facilitating their distribution, their back-up and use.
